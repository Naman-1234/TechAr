# TechAr

## Development phases:

### Phases
1. Building conceptor filter (instructor can use
conceptor filter while online lecture to present
3d models to student) . As building conceptor
filter will be a good start for our project we will
be using unity tool with vuforia package(used
for augmented reality in unity) in C# language
to develop it. As a prototype we will create the
conceptor filter using 2-3 3d models for a
sample lecture to illustrate how actually it will
work during online lecture.

2. Initiating websystem development as we
promised to build a system where instructor
can create/manage/edit lecture as well as
student can access/doubt any lecture at any
time with proper authentication as only admin
having access to add instructor and only
instructor can add lecture and pass link to
students.


3. Integrating three.js javascript library with
websystem this will help instructor to add 3d
models into the lecture gist formed in techAr
websystem so that student can also on their
own can playaround/understand difficult
concepts with 3d model


4. If time permits we will try to enhance the
already built features of web system.

## Current development status 

We had concurrently started the working on phase 1 and phase 2 due to limited amount of time via giving more priority to phases 1 development with completion of some basic pages phase 2 development. Once phase 1 development get's completed our whole priority will shift to phase 2 development.
